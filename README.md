# Docker Training

This repo contains all the material and labs used during my docker training session. It's a five hours training from theory to several hands on labs.

## Labs

### Module I - Containers and Docker

Module I is all about what is docker and several important concepts so no practical lab.

### Module II - Docker Installation and Setup

Docker can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux. Since these options are frequently updated by Docker team, I'll use their web site to get everything we need.

1. Install Docker for your Operating System
    * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#about-windows-containers-and-windows-server-2016)
    * [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/#whats-in-the-box) - For older Windows and Mac versions
    * [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/), [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/) - Check the Docker website for other Linux distributions.

2. Check your installation

    After installing open your command line (or start docker toolbox command line) and run `docker version`, you should get a response with informtion about the docker client and server installed on your machine.
